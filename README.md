# Asciimon
Pokemon-inspired game created using Rust for ANSI terminals

This is my first project using Rust, so feel free to point out anything "not Rusty" in the code :)

## Contributing

The game is early in development, and so I am regularly making changes to the code.

Because of this, contributions will likely be unable to be merged, or possibly change things without considering plans I have for the game:

Small changes I am fine with. This means things that are not a major refactor or adding a feature; but rather just changing a couple of lines of code or fixing some random code style. Example: https://github.com/Hopson97/Asciimon/pull/31

Large changes are very unlikely to added. If you wish to make a large change, please let me know first, or else I probably will not merge it.

Thanks for understanding!
